# Ansible Role: dropbear_initramfs

An Ansible role that deploys and configures `dropbear-initramfs` so that Linux boxes that use full disk encryption based on LUKS can be unlocked remotely via SSH.

## üöÄ Motivation

Some of the Linux boxes I manage were installed with full disk encryption based on LUKS enabled. It would be nice to be able to unlock these LUKS volumes remotely via SSH.

## üìë Role Variables

Check `defaults/main.yml`.

## üß∞ Dependencies

None.

## ‚ö° Quick start

An example of how integrate this role to an Ansible playbook can be found here:

```yml

  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  vars:
    dropbear_initramfs__authorized_ssh_keys:
      - example
  roles:
    - fernandobohrer.dropbear_initramfs
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility

This role was tested on and is confirmed to work with the following Linux distributions:

- `Debian 12`
- `Ubuntu 22.04`
- `Ubuntu 24.04`

Details can be found in the [Molecule][01] scenarios available in the `molecule` folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This Ansible role was tested on the above mentioned Linux distributions considering their default configuration. Your environment might have a different configuration or requirements which might conflict with the options that this role uses.

With the above in mind, it is **imperative** that you familiarize yourself with what this role does and test it on non-production machines **before** applying it to machines in a production environment.
